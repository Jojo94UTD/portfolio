        <h2>Agile Scrum Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            During my internship, I worked within an Agile Scrum framework, taking part in daily meetings, sprint cycles, backlog management, user stories definition, acceptance criteria validation, and sprint reviews. This experience allowed me to understand how software projects are organized and delivered in a professional environment, and how communication and collaboration play a key role in the success of a development team.

        <h2>Interface Contracts</h2>
        <p>
            The project was built around an OpenAPI interface contract, defined upstream by the team. Although I did not design this contract myself, I developed a strong understanding of how it defines REST endpoints, request and response models, and how it serves as a single source of truth between backend and frontend. I learned how this contract enables automatic generation of backend components and frontend REST clients, ensuring consistency and reducing integration errors.

        <h2>Backend Development with Java Spring Boot</h2>
        <p>
            The backend was generated using an internal ENEDIS application generator based on Spring Boot. While I was not responsible for its initial implementation, I thoroughly studied its architecture, including configuration layers, controllers, services, repositories, entities, mappers, and database persistence. This allowed me to clearly understand how REST APIs are structured, how business logic is implemented, and how the backend interacts with the database.

        <h2>Angular Frontend Development</h2>
        <p>
            My main contribution focused on frontend development using Angular. I designed and implemented several user interfaces, including detailed views for microapplications and environments. These interfaces interact with the backend through REST services generated from the OpenAPI contract. I worked with Angular components, services, routing, forms, dialogs, and data binding to build functional and user-friendly interfaces while following best practices in a professional codebase.

        <h2>Code Review & Quality Control with Sonar</h2>
        <p>
            I worked in a development environment where code quality was closely monitored using Sonar. I learned how to interpret quality indicators such as code smells, bugs, and maintainability metrics, and how to improve my code accordingly. This experience raised my awareness of clean code principles and the importance of maintainable and reliable software in an enterprise context.

        <h2>Version Control with GitLab</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout the internship, I used GitLab as the main version control platform. I worked with branches, commits, and merge requests, and followed team workflows for code integration and validation. This allowed me to gain experience in collaborative development practices and to understand the importance of clear commit history and structured code reviews.
